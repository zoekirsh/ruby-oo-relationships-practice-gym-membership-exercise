Word has just come from the higher-ups, and you're in charge of building out a domain that keeps track of weightlifters and the gyms they lift at.  Yes gyms. Everyone knows you need a weekday gym and a weekend gym. And one for when you're traveling, and one that you go to just to show off.  Oh, and that one with a really great steam room.  Gotta love the steam room.

## Setup (Code Overview)

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`.

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

There are **no** tests! You will need to test your code on your own!!

**Troubleshooting:** If `ruby tools/console.rb` does not work, try running `bundle install` in your terminal.

## Deliverables

Here's what we need to be able to do.

**Lifter**

  - [x] Get a list of all lifters

  - [x] Get a list of all the memberships that a specific lifter has

  - [x] Get a list of all the gyms that a specific lifter has memberships to

  - [x] Get the average lift total of all lifters

  - [x] Get the total cost of a specific lifter's gym memberships

  - [x] Given a gym and a membership cost, sign a specific lifter up for a new gym

**Membership**

  - [x] Get a list of all memberships

**Gym**

  - [x] Get a list of all gyms

  - [x] Get a list of all memberships at a specific gym

  - [x] Get a list of all the lifters that have a membership to a specific gym

  - [x] Get a list of the names of all lifters that have a membership to that gym

  - [x] Get the combined lift total of every lifter that has a membership to that gym
